h2. XBox 360 on Nexus 7 

I was wondering if I could use a gamepad on my Nexus 7 android tablet since I played with a mouse on it. And it does work, out of the box. Even the android UI plays along.

h3. Prerequisites 

You actually don't need much : 
  
* An android tablet (obviously)
* A supported Gamepad (here a Xbox360 controller)
* A USB-OTG cable (micro-usb to usb for me, see the picture below)

h3. How it works

# Plug the USB-OTG cable in the tablet.
# Plug the controller in the cable
# Use it :)

h3. Supported games (I know of)

* Quell:reflect

I'll try to update this list as I play new games. Have fun.
