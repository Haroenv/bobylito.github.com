h2. Using github with multiple accounts

Nowadays having a github account is quite convenient (if not mandatory for some). It really helps show where are your skill to potential employers or future clients. The only problem is that when you finally got hired by this dream company who has looked for you on Github, you realize they use Github too. Therefore you might wonder if you should use your very own/personnal account. 

I decided to open a distinct account for this purpose. And here is my personnal recipe to use both accounts on my computer. 

Disclaimer : I use MacOS X and Linux, and I don't have a clue how it could work for windows.

h3. SSH Keys

I'll assume here you already have keys and their public parts and they are both registered on your github accounts. Let's say, we have the following in our ~/.ssh folder :
<pre><code>config
id_rsa_alice
id_rsa_alice.pub
id_rsa_bob
id_rsa_bob.pub
</code></pre>

Now let's edit the _config_ file. We are adding some url specific configuration : 
<pre><code>Host alice.github.com
  Hostname github.com
  User git 
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_alice
Host bob.github.com
  Hostname github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_bob
</code></pre>

These lines actually make automatic redirection to github to the specific user when using either bob.github.com or alice.github.com. 

For example, when you want to clone a repository with Bob account, instead of using:
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:bob/bobsproject.git</code></pre>

You should use :
<pre><code>git clone git@bob.github.com:bob/bobsproject.git</code></pre>

The same way, when configuring an origin for an Alice project, it be should set this way:
<pre><code>git remote add origin git@alice.github.com:alice/p1.git</code></pre>

But there is a trick (or a bug if you are a half empty glass person), and the person who will commit will be the one configure in the git configuration.

h3. Configure git

There are two ways for configuring git : either globally or project specific. And because we use two certificates, it has to be project specific. To configure Alice in a git project you have to type the following commands, go to the project folder and type : 
<pre><code>$ git config user.name "Alice In Wonderland"
$ git config user.email "alice@wonderland.com"
</code></pre>

h3. That's it

Well here you are, you have everything you might need to use multiples github accounts at once. Please leave a comment, if you have errors or a better solution.
